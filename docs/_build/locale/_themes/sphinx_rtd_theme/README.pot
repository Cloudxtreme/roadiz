The good news is I have a very nice set of grunt_ operations that will not only load these dependecies, but watch for changes, rebuild the sphinx demo docs and build a distributable version of the theme. The bad news is this means you'll need to set up your environment similar to that of a front-end developer (vs. that of a python developer). That means installing node and ruby."

I know there are a lot of Python engineers out there that can't code sass / css and are unable to submit pull requests. That said, submitting random style bugs without at least providing sample documentation that replicates your problem is a good way for me to ignore your request. RST unfortunately can spit out a lot of things in a lot of ways. I don't have time to research your problem for you, but I do have time to fix the actual styling issue if you can replicate the problem for me."
